RL-Viz provides the reinforcement learning community for the first time ever with a flexible, general, standardized, cross language and cross platform protocol/framework for managing and visualizing the interaction between agents and environments in reinforcement learning experiments.  RL-Viz is a protocol and library written on top of RL-Glue, a proposed standard communication protocol for reinforcement learning.

RL-Glue is a language and platform-independent protocol for evaluating reinforcement-learning agents with environment programs. RL-Glue separates the agent and environment development process so that each can be written in different languages, and even executed over the Internet from different computers.

RL-Viz is a project layered over RL-Glue.  RL-Viz supports advanced features such as visualization of environments and agents and run-time loading of agents and environments.

RL-Viz is being used as the foundation for the  upcoming [Reinforcement Learning Competition](http://rl-competition.org), between November 2007 and May 2008, culminating in an event at the [International Conference on Machine Learning 2008](http://icml2008.cs.helsinki.fi/).


RL-Viz is heavily used in the currently being released [RL-Library](http://rl-library.googlecode.com).

## This Project is not really **live** Yet ##
We're still developing infrastructure and working kinks out in preparation for the first official release of RL-Viz.  Stay tuned.
